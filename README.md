# Java-DICOM-reader
The application loads the volume of images in DICOM format and shows it using 3 mutually perpendicular views. You can navigate through each view using the slider, presenting subsequent sections.
You can adjust the intensity projection range (window/level) with the values read from the DICOM file.
Additionally, you can measure the distance between 2 points (taking into account the voxel size) on each projection.
